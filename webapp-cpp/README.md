# WEBAPP-CPP

This is a replacement for the other webapp written in Haskell. It aims to be completely compatible
but faster and more efficient (as it is written in C++).

You need the following pieces as dependencies:

* libsocket
* libcurl (-dev/-devel)
* libprotobuf (-dev/-devel)
* libfcgi (-dev/-devel)
